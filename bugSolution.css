To correct the `calc()` function issues, use parentheses to ensure correct operator precedence and maintain consistent units within the calculations:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 100px);
}

/*Corrected version*/
.element {
  width: calc((50% - 100px)); /*Explicitly setting the precedence*/
}

/* Another example with unit issues */
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 10em); /*Mixing percentage with em unit is generally okay */
}

.element {
  height: calc(100px + 20%); /*This will result in error due to mixing px and percentage*/
}

/* Corrected Version */
.element {
  height: calc(100px + (20%/100) * 100px); /*Correct calculation by converting 20% to pixels*/
}
```

By carefully using parentheses and ensuring consistent unit usage, you can effectively prevent errors when working with the `calc()` function.
