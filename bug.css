The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling. For example, the following code intends to calculate the width as 50% - 100px, but it may not work as expected due to operator precedence issues:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 100px);
}
```

The subtraction happens before the percentage calculation, resulting in a negative value.  Another problem can arise when mixing units inconsistently within the `calc()` function, causing the calculation to fail or produce incorrect results.
